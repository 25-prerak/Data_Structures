1. Implement the following stack operations using a char array:push , pop, read, and change
2. Implement a Infix to Postfix convertor that takes an infix-expression string and generates the postfix string as an output
3. Implement an program to evaluate a Postfix expression involving numbers and operators (e.g. 10 15 + 20 * should result in 500)
4. factorial calculation
5. GCD of two numbers
6. Tower  of Hanoi for N plates
7. Implement the insert and delete operations for a First-in-First-out queue
8. Implement the insert and delete operations for a First-in-First-out queue Circular Queue
9. Implement a queuing program that supports three levels of priority (0- Highest, 1, and 2). An element with higher priority should be processed (removed) before the lower priority ones.  Comment about the fairness in this basic implementation.
