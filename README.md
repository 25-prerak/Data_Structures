All codes related to Data Structures

1. Implement the following stack operations using a char array:push , pop, read, and change
2. Implement a Infix to Postfix convertor that takes an infix-expression string and generates the postfix string as an output
3. Implement an program to evaluate a Postfix expression involving numbers and operators (e.g. 10 15 + 20 * should result in 500)
4. factorial calculation
5. GCD of two numbers
6. Tower  of Hanoi for N plates
7. Implement the insert and delete operations for a First-in-First-out queue
8. Implement the insert and delete operations for a First-in-First-out queue Circular Queue
9. Implement a queuing program that supports three levels of priority (0- Highest, 1, and 2). An element with higher priority should be processed (removed) before the lower priority ones.  Comment about the fairness in this basic implementation.
10.insert at the head (front), insert at the tail (end), insert in an ordered list, insert before/after a node with value v
    Delete from head (front) , delete from the tail (end), delete a node with value v,
    traverse and display the linked list 
11.Implement the doubly linked list with all of the above operations
12.Implement a circular linked list with all of the above operations
13.Represent a polynomial with two variables (e.g. x and y) using a linked list. Write functions perform the following arithmetic operations on two polynomials: add, subtract, multiply, and divide
